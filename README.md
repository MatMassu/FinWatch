|---------------------------------------------------------------------  FinWatch (WIP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------|
A free web app for effortless finance tracking: monitor your income, manage expenses, and visualize your financial health with intuitive graphs and charts

This project serves both as a tool that I'll use daily to track my finances (beats having 13 haphazardly placed graphs on a spreadsheet) and as a way of learning some useful application development concepts, including but not limited to:

  - Developing a robust backend system with user authentication and data management.         ---> Django
  - Building a dynamic and user-friendly frontend interface.                                 ---> React
  - Creating and configuring a secure, efficient database.                                   ---> PostgreSQL
  - Containerizing an application to guarantee portability.                                  ---> Docker
  - Setting up a virtual environment/subsystem to keep the source files tidy and organized.  ---> Ubuntu WSL and Venv
  - Version control and documentation.                                                       ---> Git and GitHub

My objective is to fully develop a working web app, ready to be used by anyone with an email and a keyboard, while having little to no experience working with some of these tools and relying completely on the available documentation, online forums, and a rubber duck. 

Development of FinWatch was started on the 10th of June, 2024 by Matias Massucco.
